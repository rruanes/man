# Group HomeWork (25):

Use ChickWeight.csv dataset inside ForSharing>Datasets.  Assume that weight measurements per chick x diet are automatically uploaded every time period ’Time’ to a repository that you have access to.  Loop the codes in slides 23-25 to check (every time period) for any outlier data i.e. weight outside the 3sd thresholds. R code should:

1.) Import data for a given time period ‘Time’ from a directory
2.) Calculate LCL and UCL for the given time period
3.) Flag if LCL / UCL has been breached for the period Time
